# Dynamic Querying and Insights from Transactional Data

## ðŸ“„ Project Description
This project showcases SQL querying using a transactional dataset (`Transactions` table). The dataset simulates real-world transaction data with columns such as `TransactionID`, `CustomerID`, `Date`, and `Amount`. The focus is on solving complex business problems dynamically, optimizing queries, and demonstrating SQL capabilities.

Through this project, I aim to:
- Explore common data analysis tasks in SQL.
- Solve diverse real-world problems using advanced SQL techniques.
- Showcase best practices for writing efficient and dynamic queries.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Dynamic Date Filtering**: Retrieve data for specific periods (quarters, months, weekends, etc.) dynamically.
- **Aggregations**: Calculate cumulative revenue, monthly averages, and total spend per customer.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Identify trends, such as the most profitable customers or high-revenue months.
  - Filter data based on relative metrics, such as transactions below the average.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**:
  - Window functions for rankings and cumulative totals.
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readability and modular queries.
  - Subqueries and joins for in-depth analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
A custom dataset is used for this project, modeled as a `Transactions` table with the following schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    TransactionID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID VARCHAR(50),
    Date DATE,
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
